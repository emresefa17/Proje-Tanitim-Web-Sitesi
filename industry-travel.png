This file should be replaced with the image from the reference.

Since I cannot create an actual PNG file, please replace this with the leftmost image from the "Multiple Industries" section. The image shows a colorful coastal town with buildings in pastel colors (possibly in Italy or Greece), with houses stacked on a hillside overlooking water. This represents the Travel Agency industry.
